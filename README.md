10. Object Tracking using Optical Flow and Kalman Filter
Project Description:
In this project, you’ll build an object tracking system using Optical Flow to detect the movement of objects across frames and a Kalman Filter to track the position of an object with uncertainty and noise. This system will allow you to track an object’s position in a video or a series of images.
You’ll first use Optical Flow to estimate the motion between two consecutive frames. Then, you’ll apply a Kalman Filter to smooth the object's path and predict future positions while correcting noise and errors in the tracking process.
